It was the BEST OF EVERYTHING!,
With apologies to Charles Dickens...
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of darkness,
it was the season of light,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair.
it was the worst of times,
